# Graph Generation and Pre-Processing

This folder contains programs for generating LFR benchmark graphs and performing pre-processing tasks. The programs `Gene_1k.py` and `Gene_10k.py` are specifically designed for generating LFR benchmark graphs with 1,000 and 10,000 nodes, respectively.

## Program Files

- **Graph Generation:**
  - `Gene_1k.py`: Program to generate LFR benchmark graphs with 1,000 nodes.
  - `Gene_10k.py`: Program to generate LFR benchmark graphs with 10,000 nodes.
  - `Gene_Btwn_Rank.ipynb`: Program to generate nodes betweenness centrality rank.

## Output Files

For each LFR benchmark graph generated, the following output files are stored in this folder:

- For example, for an LFR benchmark graph with 1,000 nodes and a mixing parameter of 0.01:
  - `graph_1000_0.01.between`: File storing the betweenness centrality of nodes.
  - `graph_1000_0.01.edgelist`: File storing the edgelist of the generated graph.
  - `graph_1000_0.01.membership`: File storing the community membership of nodes.

- Additionally, `graph_1000_0.01.rank` is generated by `Gene_Btwn_Rank.ipynb` to store the betweenness centrality rank of nodes.

## Usage

1. Run the appropriate graph generation program (`Gene_1k.py` or `Gene_10k.py`) to generate LFR benchmark graphs.
2. Utilize the generated output files for further analysis.

## Notes

- The naming convention for output files includes information about the graph size and mixing parameter.
- `graph_1000_0.01.rank` is generated by running `Gene_Btwn_Rank.ipynb` to provide betweenness centrality ranks.

Feel free to explore and utilize the generated graphs and associated data for your research.
